# [ODE systems for computing the guiding term](@id ode_types)
****************************
The guiding term can be computed in a variety of ways. Here, we provide [four distinct methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03807.pdf)—corresponding to three systems of ODEs and a direct method via evaluations of matrix exponentials—for achieving this feat.

!!! warning
    Currently only a method via solving ODEs for $H$, $F$ and $c$ has been implemented.
