# [ODE systems for computing the guiding term](@id ode_types)
The guiding term can be computed in a variety of ways. Here, we provide [three distinct methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03807.pdf)---corresponding to solving three systems of ODEs---for achieving this feat.

## TODO direct computations via matrix exponentials (doubling etc.) without having to
