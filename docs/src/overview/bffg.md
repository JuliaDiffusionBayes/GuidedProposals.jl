# Backward filtering-forward guiding algorithm
This package implements a computational framework from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03807) for computing various terms of guided proposals. In particular, we provide high-level routines that correspond to the two main sweeps of the main algorithm:
- `backward_filter` &
- `forward_guide`.
Both of them operate on an already initialized vector of `GuidProp` that corresponds to a `recording`.
## Forward guide
The `forward_guide`

## Backward filter
